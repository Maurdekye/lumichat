## Docker Deployment

The first time you deploy the app, you'll need to apply the migrations to the database. Run `setup_db.sh` to deploy and initialize the database. Afterwards, run `docker compose up -d` to build and deploy the app and its remaining components.

To disable the app, run `docker compose down`. To redeploy again in the future, run `docker compose up -d`.

## Local Development (Linux / WSL2)

To set up a local development environment in Linux, you'll need to install a few things:

* The [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Then, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install the `libpq-dev` package
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libpq-dev

# Install the trunk build tool and wasm build target
cargo install --locked trunk
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Initialize the database
./setup_db.sh

# Deploy auxiliary docker services
docker compose up -d db redis llm-api

# Set environment variables
export $(cat .env | xargs)

# Build the frontend
cd front
trunk build --release # i've had issues building it on debug, so for now, just build with `--release`
cd ..

# Build & run the backend
cargo run
```
To redeploy changes to the backend, rerun `cargo run`. To redeploy changes to the frontend, `cd` into `front` and run `trunk build`. The new frontend changes should be accessible without restarting the backend; just force refresh the page with shift+F5.

## Local Development (Windows)

Deploying a local development environment in Windows is currently unsupported.
